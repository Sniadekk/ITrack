# ITrack
Application made for managing our resources. Spring + React </br>
This project is abandoned. </br>
It was my first contact with Spring and React. </br>
Even though I stopped working on this one I completed like 80% of my basic idea which was application to make managing items easier. </br>
App allows to create new categories and add items to them. Simple example of a sql relations.</br></br>
